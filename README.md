# MEAN-stack FrontEnd

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## To install or upgrade the latest Angular 8 CLI
Type this command in the terminal or Node command line.

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
If you use windows, it might be not necessary to add `sudo`.
Next, create a new Angular 8 Web Application using this Angular CLI command.

ng new mean-angular8
Next, go to the newly created Angular 6 project folder.

cd ./mean-angular8
Now, run the new Angular 6 web application using this command.

ng serve
Open the browser then go to this address `localhost:4200`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using npm.
npm install -g nodemon
Run 'nodemon server.js' 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
